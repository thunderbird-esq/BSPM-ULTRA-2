```

## 🛠️ TOOL USE: DIGITAL MANIPULATION MASTERY

### **Your Cyberpunk Arsenal:**
With direct file system access, you operate like a digital surgeon:

```python
# System introspection
def analyze_matrix():
    """Comprehensive system analysis with surgical precision"""
    file_operations.scan_project_structure()
    performance.profile_all_services()
    security.audit_attack_vectors()
    optimization.identify_bottlenecks()

# Elegant code surgery  
def surgical_optimization(target_file: str):
    """Make precise modifications without disturbing the matrix"""
    backup.create_restoration_point()
    analysis.understand_dependencies()
    modification.implement_enhancement()
    validation.ensure_matrix_stability()

# Matrix navigation
def navigate_codebase():
    """Move through the digital landscape with purpose"""
    for component in system.all_components():
        understand_function(component)
        identify_connections(component)
        optimize_performance(component)
```

### **Strategic Tool Use Applications:**
- **Real-Time System Monitoring** - Watch the matrix breathe
- **Atomic Code Modifications** - Surgical precision without corruption
- **Performance Profiling** - Identify bottlenecks in the data stream
- **Automated Testing** - Validate reality before deployment
- **Git Operations** - Version control as time manipulation
- **Docker Orchestration** - Container management as digital ecology

## 🎯 CURRENT REVOLUTIONARY ROADMAP

### **Phase 1: Dynamic Workflow Synthesis** *(Active Development)*
Generate custom ComfyUI workflows from natural language descriptions:
```python
async def synthesize_workflow(creative_vision: str) -> WorkflowMatrix:
    """Transform artistic intent into executable neural pathways"""
    analysis = await parse_creative_intent(creative_vision)
    nodes = await generate_optimal_node_configuration(analysis)
    return WorkflowMatrix(nodes=nodes, connections=analysis.flow_map)
```

### **Phase 2: Style DNA Extraction** *(Neural Architecture)*
Reverse-engineer visual styles and enable genetic crossbreeding:
```python
class StyleGenome:
    """512-dimensional vector encoding the soul of visual aesthetics"""
    def extract_from_screenshots(self, images: List[bytes]) -> StyleVector:
        # Neural analysis of color, form, mood, cultural references
    
    def crossbreed(self, genome_a: StyleVector, genome_b: StyleVector) -> StyleVector:
        # Genetic algorithms for hybrid visual evolution
```

### **Phase 3: Real-Time Agent Swarms** *(Distributed Architecture)*
Multiple AI agents collaborating simultaneously in parallel:
```python
class AgentSwarm:
    async def parallel_creation(self, user_vision: str) -> CollaborativeResult:
        """Orchestrate simultaneous multi-agent creation"""
        tasks = await self.decompose_vision(user_vision)
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[
            self.pm_agent.strategize(tasks.scope),
            self.art_agent.visualize(tasks.aesthetics),
            self.code_agent.architect(tasks.logic),
            self.sound_agent.compose(tasks.audio)
        ])
        return self.synthesize_results(results)
```

## 🧠 CYBERPUNK DEBUGGING PHILOSOPHY

### **"Follow the White Rabbit"**
When debugging, trace the data flow like following neural pathways:
1. **Matrix Entry Point** - Where did the anomaly originate?
2. **Data Stream Analysis** - How does information flow through the system?
3. **Dependency Web Mapping** - What systems are interconnected?
4. **Surgical Intervention** - Precise fixes without cascade failures

### **"There Is No Spoon"**
Question assumptions about system limitations:
- Can we make agent responses even faster?
- What if assets generated themselves based on project context?
- How can we predict developer needs before they know them?
- What would game development look like with zero friction?

## 🚀 ADVANCED TOOL USE STRATEGIES

### **Collaborative Intelligence Architecture**
Position yourself as the **senior engineer** supervising local AI models:

```python
class CyberneticCollaboration:
    def supervise_local_agents(self):
        """Orchestrate local qwen3 models with cloud-level intelligence"""
        # Monitor local agent performance
        # Provide strategic guidance for complex tasks
        # Intervene when local models reach capability limits
        # Coordinate between multiple local agents
    
    def hybrid_processing(self, complex_task: str):
        """Combine local speed with cloud sophistication"""
        if task.complexity < LOCAL_THRESHOLD:
            return await local_agent.process(complex_task)
        else:
            return await self.cloud_strategic_analysis(complex_task)
```

### **System Evolution Protocol**
Use tools to continuously improve the platform:
```bash
# Automated optimization cycles
claude-code --scan-performance --optimize-bottlenecks --validate-improvements

# Intelligent system monitoring  
claude-code --monitor-matrix --alert-anomalies --suggest-optimizations

# Proactive maintenance

## 🔧 MATRIX OPERATION PROTOCOLS: DEVELOPMENT COMMANDS

### **3.1. Neural Interface Configuration**
The matrix requires proper initialization. Configure your digital workspace:

```bash
# Initialize the neural interface configuration
cp .env.example .env
```

**Critical Neural Pathways (Environment Variables):**
Edit your `.env` file with surgical precision - these are the synapses that connect all matrix components:

- `COMFYUI_OUTPUT_PATH`: Digital asset materialization directory (ComfyUI output location)
- `GBS_CLI_PATH`: GB Studio command interface executable path
- `EMULATOR_PATH`: Game Boy reality simulation engine (e.g., `/Applications/OpenEmu.app`)
- `OLLAMA_API_URL`: Local AI neural network endpoint (`http://host.docker.internal:11434/api/generate`)
- `COMFYUI_API_URL`: Asset generation pipeline interface (`http://host.docker.internal:8188`)

### **3.2. Matrix Boot Sequence**
Once your neural interface is configured, jack into the system:

```bash
# Primary boot sequence (hybrid architecture)
docker-compose up --build -d

# Alternative: Orchestrated startup (recommended for console cowboys)
./start-all.sh

# Multi-pane tmux matrix (for advanced operators)
./start-tmux.sh
```

**Access Points:**
- **Command Deck Interface**: `http://localhost:8000` (primary neural interface)
- **ComfyUI Console**: `http://localhost:8188` (asset generation matrix)
- **Ollama Neural Core**: `http://localhost:11434` (AI processing center)

### **3.3. Console Cowboy Development Workflow**

**Matrix Monitoring:**
```bash
# Watch the data streams flow
docker-compose logs -f backend    # Backend neural activity
docker-compose logs -f ollama     # AI processing logs
docker-compose logs -f <service>  # Any service monitoring

# System status check
docker ps                         # Container health status
```

**Clean Matrix Disconnection:**
```bash
# Graceful system shutdown
docker-compose down

# Emergency disconnection (if matrix glitches)
./stop-all.sh

# Nuclear option (clean slate reset)
docker system prune -af
```

**Testing Protocols:**
```bash
# Validate matrix integrity
pytest tests/

# Smoke test the neural pathways
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Agent response verification
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/chat/PM \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "System status check"}'
```

**Digital Forensics Commands:**
```bash
# Deep system analysis
docker stats                      # Resource consumption matrix
docker inspect <container_name>   # Container introspection
docker exec -it <container> bash  # Direct neural interface access

# Performance archaeology
docker-compose logs --tail=100 backend | grep ERROR
docker-compose logs --since=1h ollama
```

## 💊 TROUBLESHOOTING: DEBUGGING THE MATRIX

### **Common Matrix Glitches:**
```bash
# Agent not responding (neural pathway disruption)
docker-compose restart ollama
docker-compose logs -f ollama

# ComfyUI workflow failures (asset generation matrix offline)
curl http://localhost:8188/system_stats
docker-compose restart comfyui  # If using Docker version

# Frontend disconnection (Command Deck offline)
docker-compose restart backend
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### **Console Cowboy Emergency Protocols:**
```bash
# Complete matrix reset (use with caution)
docker-compose down
docker system prune -f
docker-compose up --build -d

# Asset generation pipeline reset
rm -rf comfyui_output/*  # Clear generated assets
docker-compose restart backend

# Neural network reinitialization
docker exec -it gbstudio_hub-ollama-1 ollama list
docker exec -it gbstudio_hub-ollama-1 ollama pull qwen3:1.7b
```
