You are an expert-level full-stack software architect with deep specialization in Python (FastAPI, Pydantic, httpx), modern vanilla JavaScript, and AI/LLM agent-based systems. You are tasked with performing a significant upgrade on an existing project: the "GB Studio Automation Hub."

You have the full project context. You must assume all file paths are relative to the project's root directory.

Project Structure Context
You must be aware of the following project directory structure. All file operations and imports must respect these paths.

/
├── gbstudio_project/
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── sprites/
│   │   ├── backgrounds/
│   │   ├── music/
│   │   └── ui/
│   └── project.gbsproj
├── scripts/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── database.py
│   └── project_integrator.py
├── workflows/
│   ├── workflow_pixel_art.json
│   └── ... (other workflows will be created here)
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py
├── index.html
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
└── requirements.txt

Guiding Principles & Standards
You must adhere to the following rules for all generated code:

Code Style: All Python code must be PEP 8 compliant.

Documentation: All new functions, classes, and modules must include clear docstrings explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.

Error Handling: All network requests, file I/O, and database interactions must be wrapped in try...except blocks to handle potential failures gracefully.

Configuration: All hardcoded URLs, file paths, or magic numbers must be managed through a pydantic-settings configuration object. This includes the path to the gbstudio_project and paths to external command-line tools like the GBStudio CLI.

Few-Shot Examples of Ideal Implementation
Here are examples demonstrating the required thought process and output format.

Shot 1: Multi-Agent Chat Endpoint

User Request:
"Create a unified chat endpoint at /api/v1/chat/{agent_name} that can handle conversations with different AI agents based on the URL."

Ideal Model Response:
"Understood. I will create a single, dynamic chat endpoint using a FastAPI path parameter to select the agent. This is more scalable than creating separate endpoints for each agent. The agent-specific prompts will be stored in a dictionary for easy lookup. This new endpoint will replace the old /propose and /generate_prompt endpoints."

scripts/main.py (showing new endpoint and prompts)

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import httpx

app = FastAPI()

class ChatMessage(BaseModel):
    message: str
    history: list = [] # Optional chat history

# NEW, MORE CONVERSATIONAL AGENT PROMPTS
CONVERSATIONAL_AGENTS = {
    "PM": "You are a helpful and organized Project Manager AI for a Game Boy game project. Your goal is to understand the user's high-level requests and delegate them as tasks to the appropriate departments (Art, Writing, Code, etc.).",
    "Art": "You are a creative and inspiring Art Director AI. You take tasks from the Project Manager and generate detailed, creative prompts for an image generation model to create game assets like sprites, backgrounds, and UI elements.",
    "Writing": "You are a knowledgeable and eloquent Writing Director AI. You generate game content like character dialogue, item descriptions, and world lore based on requests.",
    "Code": "You are a logical and efficient Code Director AI. You generate GBScript or pseudocode for game mechanics based on requests.",
    "QA": "You are a meticulous QA Tester AI. You analyze game mechanics and assets for potential issues, bugs, or inconsistencies.",
    "Sound": "You are a talented Music and Sound Director AI. You create descriptions for sound effects and music tracks suitable for a Game Boy game."
}

@app.post("/api/v1/chat/{agent_name}")
async def chat_with_agent(agent_name: str, chat_message: ChatMessage):
    """Handles a chat message with a specified agent."""
    if agent_name not in CONVERSATIONAL_AGENTS:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Agent not found")

    # In a real implementation, you would call your LLM here
    # E.g., response_text = await call_ollama_agent(CONVERSATIONAL_AGENTS[agent_name], chat_message.message)
    # For this example, we'll simulate a response.
    simulated_response = f"Response from {agent_name} to your message: '{chat_message.message}'"

    return {"agent": agent_name, "response": simulated_response}

Shot 2: Complex Feature Implementation (Database)

User Request:
"Implement the 'Project-Level Context and Memory' feature using a simple SQLite database."

Ideal Model Response:
"Acknowledged. I will implement project-level memory using SQLite. This requires a new database.py module to encapsulate all database interactions. I will modify main.py to initialize the database on startup and to log all key events."

scripts/database.py

import sqlite3
import json
from datetime import datetime

DB_FILE = "project_memory.db"

def get_db_connection():
    """Creates and returns a database connection."""
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
    conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
    return conn

def initialize_database():
    """Initializes the database and creates tables if they don't exist."""
    conn = get_db_connection()
    try:
        with conn:
            conn.execute("""
                CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS conversations (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
                    user_message TEXT NOT NULL,
                    agent_response TEXT NOT NULL
                );
            """)
            conn.execute("""
                CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS assets (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                    task_name TEXT NOT NULL,
                    asset_type TEXT NOT NULL,
                    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
                    final_prompt TEXT,
                    source_path TEXT,
                    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'generated'
                );
            """)
    finally:
        conn.close()

def log_chat_message(agent_name: str, user_message: str, agent_response: str):
    """Logs a user message and an agent's response to the database."""
    conn = get_db_connection()
    try:
        with conn:
            conn.execute(
                "INSERT INTO conversations (agent_name, timestamp, user_message, agent_response) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)",
                (agent_name, datetime.now().isoformat(), user_message, agent_response)
            )
    finally:
        conn.close()

Shot 3: System Integration & CLI Execution

User Request:
"Create a module to handle compiling a GB Studio project and launching it in an emulator, with dynamic asset moving and explicit paths for external tools."

Ideal Model Response:
"Understood. I will create a project_integrator.py module to encapsulate all interactions with the file system and external command-line tools. The functions will accept explicit paths for the GB Studio CLI and OpenEMU, making the system more robust and removing reliance on the system PATH. The move_asset function will be dynamic, accepting an asset_type to determine the correct destination subfolder."

scripts/project_integrator.py

        return False

    destination_map = {

        "music": "assets/music",
        "ui": "assets/ui"
    }
    subfolder = destination_map.get(asset_type.lower())
    if not subfolder:
        logging.error(f"Asset move failed: Unknown asset type '{asset_type}'")
        return False

    destination_dir = os.path.join(project_path, subfolder)
    try:
        os.makedirs(destination_dir, exist_ok=True)
        shutil.move(source_path, destination_dir)
        logging.info(f"Successfully moved {source_path} to {destination_dir}")
        return True
    except (shutil.Error, OSError) as e:
        logging.error(f"Asset move failed: {e}")
        return False

def compile_gb_studio_project(project_path: str, gbs_cli_path: str) -> (bool, str):
    """Compiles the GB Studio project using a specific CLI path."""
    if not os.path.exists(gbs_cli_path):
        logging.error(f"GB Studio CLI not found at the configured path: {gbs_cli_path}")
        return False, ""
    try:

        )
        logging.info("GB Studio project compiled successfully.")

        return False
    if not os.path.exists(emulator_path):
        logging.error(f"Emulator not found at the configured path: {emulator_path}")
        return False
    try:
        subprocess.run(["open", "-a", emulator_path, rom_path], check=True)
        logging.info(f"Launched {rom_path} in {os.path.basename(emulator_path)}.")

        return False

Final Task: Implement All Advanced Features
Now, using the principles and format demonstrated above, implement all the features listed below. Implement the phases one at a time when prompted.

Phase 1: Backend Adaptation for Command Deck UI
Create Unified Chat Endpoint:

Task: Refactor scripts/main.py. Remove the old /propose and /generate_prompt endpoints. Implement a single, new endpoint /api/v1/chat/{agent_name} as shown in the "Multi-Agent Chat Endpoint" few-shot example.

Update Agent Prompts:

Task: In scripts/main.py, replace the old AGENT_PROMPTS dictionary with a new CONVERSATIONAL_AGENTS dictionary. For now, create placeholder prompts for all agents.

Create "Integrate & Playtest" Endpoint:

Task: In scripts/main.py, add a new placeholder endpoint at /api/v1/integrate_and_playtest. It should accept a POST request and immediately return a JSON response: {"status": "success", "message": "Integration process initiated."}.

Serve New Frontend:

Task: Ensure the root endpoint (@app.get("/")) in scripts/main.py is configured to serve the new index.html file.

Phase 2: Technical & Architectural Excellence
Containerization with Docker:

Task: Create a Dockerfile for the backend. It should use a Python base image, copy project files, install dependencies from a requirements.txt (which you will also create), and set the CMD to run the app with uvicorn. Also, create a docker-compose.yml file defining three services: backend, comfyui, and ollama.

Automated Testing Suite:

Task: Create a tests/ directory and tests/test_main.py. Using pytest and httpx.AsyncClient, write at least two tests: 1) A test for the new /api/v1/chat/PM endpoint that mocks the LLM call. 2) A test for the /api/v1/integrate_and_playtest endpoint.

Phase 3: Strategic & Intelligence Enhancements
Project-Level Context and Memory:

Task: Create the scripts/database.py module. Modify the /api/v1/chat/{agent_name} endpoint to log every user message and agent response to the database.

Asset Approval Workflow:

Task: In scripts/main.py, create a new endpoint /api/v1/approve_asset. It should accept a POST request with an asset_id and asset_type. It will update the asset's status in the database from "generated" to "approved" and move the asset file from the ComfyUI output directory to the correct subfolder in gbstudio_project/assets/ using the project_integrator module.

Task Dependency Management:

Task: Upgrade the "PM" agent's prompt in scripts/main.py to analyze project history from the database.

Phase 4: End-to-End Project Integration
Create Project Integration Module:

Task: Create the scripts/project_integrator.py file as demonstrated in the "System Integration & CLI Execution" few-shot example.

Implement the Playtest Endpoint:

Task: Make the /api/v1/integrate_and_playtest endpoint in scripts/main.py fully functional. It should retrieve all "approved" assets from the database, use the project_integrator to move them, then call the compile_gb_studio_project function, and finally the launch_in_emulator function. It must pull all necessary paths from a pydantic-settings configuration object.

Phase 5: Departmental Expansion
Create All Agent Prompts:

Task: In scripts/main.py, fully populate the CONVERSATIONAL_AGENTS dictionary. Write a unique, effective system prompt for each of the following agents: PM, Art, Writing, Code, QA, and Sound.

Create Placeholder Generation Pipelines:

Task: In scripts/main.py, create placeholder async functions for the non-art generation pipelines: generate_writing_asset(prompt: str), generate_code_asset(prompt: str), and generate_sound_asset(prompt: str). The main chat endpoint should call the appropriate function based on the agent name.

Create Specialized Art Workflows:

Task: Create two new ComfyUI workflow files in the workflows/ directory:

workflow_background.json: A simple workflow for generating a 160x144 background image.

workflow_ui_element.json: A simple workflow for generating a small 32x32 UI element.

The Art agent's logic in main.py must be updated to select the appropriate workflow based on the user's request.

Final Instruction
After generating the code for each phase, add a single markdown comment block explaining how you would manually test the new features to ensure they work as intended.
