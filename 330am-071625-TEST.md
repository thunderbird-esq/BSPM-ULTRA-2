# Test Plan: Command Deck V2 & True Project Integration (3:30AM 07/16/25)

## 1. Objective
To perform a full, end-to-end validation of the GBStudio Automation Hub. This test will verify the entire workflow, from initial user request in the new "Command Deck" UI to the successful compilation of a playable ROM that includes a newly generated asset, with a specific focus on verifying the programmatic modification of the `.gbsproj` file.

## 2. Prerequisites
1.  **Environment Running:** The full application stack must be running. Execute `docker-compose up` from the project root and ensure all services (`backend`, `comfyui`, `ollama`) start without errors.
2.  **GB Studio Application:** The GB Studio editor application (version 4.1.3 or compatible) should be installed but **closed**.
3.  **Browser Ready:** Open a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## 3. Test Execution Steps

### Phase A: UI Loading and Initial Interaction

1.  **Action:** Load `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
2.  **Expected Result:**
    *   The "Command Deck V2" interface loads correctly with its three-panel layout.
    *   The "Project Manager" is the selected agent.
    *   In the left panel, the `websocket-status` should change from "Connecting..." to "Real-time link established."
    *   In the center panel, the `connection-status` should change from "OFFLINE" to "ONLINE".
    *   A "System" message appears in the chat log confirming the connection.

### Phase B: Art Asset Generation

1.  **Action (PM Delegation):** In the central chat panel, type a request for a new sprite. For example: `Create a sprite for a friendly shopkeeper with a big mustache.` Press Send.
2.  **Expected Result:** The PM agent responds with a JSON object delegating the task to the "Art" department (e.g., `{"department": "Art", "task_description": "A sprite for a friendly shopkeeper..."}`).

3.  **Action (Art Tasking):** In the left panel, click "Art Department". Then, in the central chat panel, paste the `task_description` from the PM's response and press Send.
4.  **Expected Result:**
    *   The Art Director agent responds with a JSON object containing the `workflow`, `asset_type`, and `prompt`.
    *   Simultaneously, in the right-hand "ACTIVE TASKS" panel, a new task card appears for the "friendly shopkeeper" with a status of "QUEUED", which then changes to "GENERATING".

### Phase C: True Integration and Manual Verification

1.  **Action (Asset Completion):** Wait for the generation process to finish.
2.  **Expected Result:** The task card in the right panel updates its status to "COMPLETED". An image of the generated shopkeeper sprite appears inside the card, along with an "Approve" button.

3.  **Action (Asset Approval):** Click the "Approve" button.
4.  **Expected Result:**
    *   The button text changes to "Approving..." and then to "Approved!".
    *   The task card's status updates to "APPROVED".
    *   A "System" message appears in the **Project Manager's** chat log confirming the asset was approved.

5.  **Action (Manual Project File Verification):**
    *   **KEEP THE WEB APP RUNNING.**
    *   Open your GB Studio project file (`gbstudio_project/project.gbsproj` or similar) directly in the **GB Studio editor application**.
    *   Navigate to the "Sprites" section in the left-hand menu of the GB Studio editor.
6.  **Expected Result (CRITICAL):** The newly generated "friendly shopkeeper" sprite appears in the list of sprites within the GB Studio editor. This confirms the `.gbsproj` JSON file was successfully and correctly modified by the backend. **If this test passes, the core of the new integration is a success.**

### Phase D: Playtest Compilation

1.  **Action:** Close the GB Studio editor application. Return to the web browser.
2.  **Action:** Click the "INTEGRATE & PLAYTEST" button in the right-hand panel of the Command Deck.
3.  **Expected Result:**
    *   The button text changes to "Integrating..." and then to "Launch Success!".
    *   A "System" message appears in the PM's chat log confirming the integration process has started and then succeeded.
    *   The OpenEmu (or configured) emulator launches automatically and starts running the newly compiled game ROM.

---
If all phases complete successfully, the entire hybrid integration workflow is fully functional.
