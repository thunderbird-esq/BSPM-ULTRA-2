# Project Status Summary - 10AM 07/16/25

## Current System State

### **Phase B Testing Status: PM Agent Natural Conversation Working**
We have successfully resolved the JSON parsing conflict and achieved natural conversation capability with agents. The system is now ready for the next phase of testing.

### **Last Successful Test Result**
- **PM Agent Response**: Working correctly with natural conversation
- **User Request**: "Create a four-frame sprite sheet for an idle animation depicting Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th"
- **PM Response**: Rich conversational response with embedded JSON delegation:
  ```
  "Okay, let's tackle this user request. The user wants a four-frame sprite sheet for Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th's idle animation. First, I need to check the project history... { "department": "Art", "task_description": "Create a four-frame sprite sheet for Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th's idle animation, including frame specifications and layout details for the Art Department to produce the artwork." }"
  ```

## **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Phase B Testing - Art Agent Workflow**
We need to complete the 2-step workflow testing:

1. **Switch to Art Department** in the left panel of the Command Deck interface
2. **Submit the task**: `"Create a four-frame sprite sheet for Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th's idle animation, including frame specifications and layout details for the Art Department to produce the artwork."`
3. **Expected Art Agent Response**: Should return JSON with:
   ```json
   {
     "workflow": "workflow_pixel_art.json",
     "asset_type": "sprite", 
     "prompt": "detailed ComfyUI prompt for Jason Voorhees sprite sheet"
   }
   ```
4. **Verify**: Task appears in right panel "ACTIVE TASKS" with status "QUEUED" → "GENERATING"

### **Outstanding Workflow Question**
User noted that the current PM response lacks workflow selection intelligence. Current system:
- **PM Agent**: Delegates to department only
- **Art Agent**: Selects workflow based on asset type

**Future consideration**: Should PM be smarter about pre-selecting workflows?

## **System Architecture Current State**

### **Docker Services Status**
- **Backend**: Port 8000 - ✅ Running with natural conversation support
- **ComfyUI**: Port 8188 - ✅ Running (some custom node warnings, but core functional)
- **Ollama**: Port 11434 - ✅ Running qwen3:1.7b model optimized for speed

### **Model Configuration**
- **Primary Model**: `qwen3:1.7b` (1.4GB, 3-4 second response times)
- **Performance**: 80x+ improvement over previous llama3 setup
- **Capabilities**: Natural conversation with embedded JSON, reasoning transparency

### **Backend Code Status**
- **JSON Parsing**: Fixed - no longer forces JSON parsing
- **Response Format**: `{"response": "full_model_response", "type": "conversation"}`
- **Conversation Support**: Full context preservation and natural language interaction

## **Testing Protocol Reference**

### **Phase B Test Steps (From 330am-071625-TEST.md)**
1. **PM Delegation**: ✅ COMPLETED - PM successfully delegates to Art department
2. **Art Agent Processing**: ⏳ NEXT - Need to test Art agent workflow selection
3. **Asset Generation**: ⏳ PENDING - ComfyUI integration test
4. **Task Status Updates**: ⏳ PENDING - WebSocket real-time updates
5. **Asset Approval**: ⏳ PENDING - Approval workflow test

### **Phase C & D (Future)**
- **Phase C**: Asset approval workflow and integration
- **Phase D**: GB Studio project integration and emulator launch

## **Key Files Modified Recently**
- **scripts/main.py**: Updated agent response handling for natural conversation
- **DEVLOG.md**: Updated with V9 (performance) and V10 (conversation) entries
- **Docker containers**: Backend restarted to apply code changes

## **Known Issues**
- **ComfyUI Custom Nodes**: Missing cv2 and git modules (warnings only, not blocking)
- **Workflow Intelligence**: PM agent could be enhanced to pre-select workflows
- **Testing Incomplete**: Need to complete Art agent → ComfyUI pipeline

## **System Performance**
- **Response Time**: 3-4 seconds for agent interactions
- **Model Loading**: 45ms (model stays resident)
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient with 1.4GB model vs previous 4.6GB
- **Stability**: No backend crashes, natural conversation working

## **Next Session Priorities**
1. **Complete Phase B Testing**: Test Art agent workflow selection
2. **Validate ComfyUI Integration**: Ensure asset generation pipeline works
3. **Test WebSocket Updates**: Verify real-time task status updates
4. **Consider Workflow Enhancement**: Decide on PM intelligence level
5. **Document Results**: Update DEVLOG.md with Phase B completion

## **Environment Notes**
- **System**: macOS Catalina 10.15.7, 7.7GiB RAM
- **Docker**: All services containerized and running
- **Development**: Volume mounts active for real-time code updates
- **Database**: SQLite with conversation and asset tracking

## **User Feedback Integration**
- User prefers natural conversation over rigid JSON responses ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- User wants full model responses including reasoning process ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- User identified workflow intelligence gap ⏳ NOTED FOR FUTURE

**STATUS**: Ready to continue Phase B testing with Art agent workflow validation.
