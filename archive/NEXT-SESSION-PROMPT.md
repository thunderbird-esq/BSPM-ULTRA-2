**CONTEXT RESTORATION PROMPT:**

I'm continuing work on the GB Studio Asset Generation Hub project. Please read the following files to understand our current state:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project overview and development commands
2. **DEVLOG.md** - Complete development history (focus on V9 and V10 entries)
3. **SUMMARY-10AM-071625.md** - Exact current status and next steps
4. **330am-071625-TEST.md** - Testing protocol we're following

**CURRENT STATUS**: We just completed Phase B step 1 (PM agent working with natural conversation) and are ready for Phase B step 2 (Art agent workflow testing).

**IMMEDIATE TASK**: We need to test the Art agent by switching to "Art Department" in the Command Deck interface and submitting: `"Create a four-frame sprite sheet for Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th's idle animation, including frame specifications and layout details for the Art Department to produce the artwork."`

**SYSTEM STATE**: Docker services running, backend updated for natural conversation, qwen3:1.7b model optimized and working, no code changes needed.

**NEXT STEPS**: Complete Phase B testing (Art agent â†’ ComfyUI pipeline), then move to Phase C (approval workflow).

Please confirm you've read the files and are ready to continue testing from where we left off.
