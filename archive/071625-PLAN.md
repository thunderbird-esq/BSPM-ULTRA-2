# GBStudio Automation Hub Frontend Unification Plan (07/16/25) - V2

## 1. Objective

To synthesize the advanced, functional backend connectivity of `index.html` with the superior, modern "cyberpunk" aesthetic and layout of `deepsite-GUI.html`. The goal is to create a single, production-ready user interface that is both highly functional and visually compelling, abandoning the previous retro-pixel theme in favor of the more sophisticated design.

## 2. High-Level Analysis of Key Files

*   **`index.html` (The "Functional Core"):** This file is the most functionally advanced. It has working WebSocket connections for real-time task updates, functioning API calls to the correct multi-agent endpoints, and logic for asset approval and playtesting. Its UI, however, is a basic retro-pixel design.
*   **`deepsite-GUI.html` (The "Visual Target"):** This file represents the desired visual and structural end-state. It features a sleek, three-panel "Command Deck" layout with a cyberpunk aesthetic, superior CSS, and a user-friendly design for switching between agent conversations. Its JavaScript is currently placeholder/mock data.

## 3. Proposed Unified Architecture: "Command Deck V2"

The final frontend will be a fusion of these two files, taking the HTML/CSS structure from `deepsite-GUI.html` and injecting the JavaScript logic from `index.html`.

### 3.1. Layout & HTML

*   **Foundation:** The HTML structure from `deepsite-GUI.html` will be used as the new `index.html`.
*   **Panel Allocation:**
    *   **Left Sidebar (`<aside>`):** Will be used for Department/Agent selection as designed.
    *   **Center Panel (`<main>`):** Will serve as the primary chat/interaction window.
    *   **Right Sidebar (`<aside>`):** Will be repurposed to become the "Active Tasks & Asset Viewer". It will display real-time task updates and show generated assets for approval, combining concepts from both parent files.

### 3.2. Styling (CSS)

*   **Primary Stylesheet:** The modern, cyberpunk-themed CSS from `deepsite-GUI.html` will be adopted.
*   **Externalization:** All styles will be moved to an external stylesheet at `static/css/main.css` for maintainability.
*   **Class Merging:** CSS classes for dynamically generated content (like task status indicators and asset approval buttons) from `index.html` will be adapted to match the new aesthetic.

### 3.3. Functionality (JavaScript)

*   **Core Logic:** The entire JavaScript logic block from `index.html` will be migrated. It is the functional heart of the application.
*   **Externalization:** The migrated and refactored JavaScript will reside in `static/js/app.js`.
*   **Adaptation & Integration (The Core Task):**
    1.  **Element Re-mapping:** The script will be updated to target the new element IDs and classes from the `deepsite-GUI.html` structure. For example, `document.getElementById('chat-window')` will become `document.getElementById('chat-log')`.
    2.  **Agent Switching:** The department/agent selection logic from `deepsite-GUI.html` will be integrated. Clicking a department will now change the `currentAgent` variable, directing subsequent messages to the correct API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/chat/Art`).
    3.  **WebSocket Handler:** The WebSocket `onmessage` handler will be rewritten to intelligently route incoming data to the correct panel in the new UI (e.g., new tasks to the right sidebar, chat messages to the center panel).
    4.  **API Calls:** All API calls (`fetch`) will be preserved but may need slight adjustments to accommodate the new agent-switching logic.

## 4. Action Plan & Next Steps

1.  **Cleanup:** Delete the old `functional-index-5AM-062125.html` and `071225-index.html` files to avoid confusion.
2.  **Foundation:** Overwrite `index.html` with the content of `deepsite-GUI.html`.
3.  **Directory Setup:** Create `static/js/` directory.
4.  **Externalization:**
    *   Create `static/css/main.css` and move all `<style>` content into it.
    *   Create `static/js/app.js` and move the `<script>` content from the *original* `index.html` into it.
5.  **HTML Linking:** Update the new `index.html` to link to the external CSS and JS files.
6.  **JavaScript Refactoring (The Main Effort):**
    *   Systematically go through `static/js/app.js` and update all DOM selectors (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, etc.) to match the new HTML structure.
    *   Implement the agent-switching logic.
    *   Rewrite the WebSocket data handling to populate the new three-panel layout.
7.  **Testing:**
    *   **Full End-to-End Test:**
        1.  Send a message to the PM.
        2.  Receive a delegation plan.
        3.  Switch to the Art agent's view.
        4.  Send the task to the Art agent.
        5.  See the task appear in the right-hand "Active Tasks" panel via WebSocket.
        6.  See the generated image appear with an "Approve" button.
        7.  Click "Approve" and verify the API call is made.
        8.  Click the "Integrate & Playtest" button and verify its functionality.

This revised plan leverages the strengths of both key files to produce a vastly superior final product, combining a professional, modern UI with proven, functional backend integration.
